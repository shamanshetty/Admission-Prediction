# Jamboree Admission Prediction Project

This notebook aims to analyze factors influencing graduate school admissions based on various parameters. The project involves:

1.  **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Reading the dataset, handling missing values, and preparing the data for analysis.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of key variables and exploring relationships between them.
3.  **Correlation Analysis**: Examining the correlation between numerical and categorical features.
4.  **Regression Modeling**: Building a linear regression model to predict the chance of admission.
5.  **Clustering**: Applying K-means clustering to identify potential groups within the data.


This Project is completely performed in R.
